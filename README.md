# Yennefer: A Rainmeter suite

*Rainmeter* is a desktop application for *Windows* similar to *conky* on *Linux*. It allows the user to highly cutomize what is shown on the desktop by displaying small widget-like programs called *skins* that one can drag around. Each *skin* can contain a number of elements, but usually have a specific task like showing the current CPU usage. A collection of such *skins* are collected in what is known as a *suit*.

To use this suite, download and install Rainmeter from [https://www.rainmeter.net/](https://www.rainmeter.net/). Then go to the directory where Rainmeter stores the different installed skins, which is usually found at `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins`. Then download this repository into that directory by e.g. issuing the command
```
git clone https://github.com/9cco/RainmeterSkinYennefer.git
```
To load the skin, start Rainmeter, then left-click the Rainmeter icon the taskbar, or, alternatively, right-click and choose '*Manage*' from the menue. Click '*Refresh all*' and
the folder '*Yennefer*' should appear in the '*Skins*' tab. Click the folder and navigate to the skin in the *Yennefer* suite that you want to load. Then click the '*Load*' button and the skin should start running on you desktop.
